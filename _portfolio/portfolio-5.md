In this project, I build a space-themed shooter game using JavaScript's framework Phaser 3, a "fast, free and fun open-source framework for Canvas and WebGL powered browser games".

The gamesâ€™ based on futurama. Futurama is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Matt Groening that aired on Fox from March 28, 1999 to August 10, 2003 and on Comedy Central from March 23, 2008 to September 4, 2013.

Enemies appear at the top of the canvas Some shoot you, some pass straight, some pursue you. You control the ship with keyboard arrows while you shoot with the spacebar. Just destroy as many enemies as you can before your HP runs out and you die.

In the end, you can add your name to our Leader Board and check the high scores. The player will be part of the planet express crew in a bid to deliver precious cargo amidst space battle.
