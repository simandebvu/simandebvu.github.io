I’m a full-stack software developer. I have had experience in a variety of stacks and am currently reading and also starting my research in personalised medicine and its potential applications. I received my BSc in Computer And Information Systems from  [Africa University](https://africau.edu) and currently a student at [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/).


I’m interested in applying personalized medicine approaches for public health and novel solutions to some of the challenges we have been facing like global warming. During my school years, I was an active leader and participant who equal opportunities for all and in the power of community. I was part of school business initiatives which were but not limited to

- Gender Equality in business
- Technical approaches for social good


My key beliefs are kaizen and application of knowledge with the belief that one never stops learning, or improving. When I am not writing code, I am most probably trying to workout or binge watch something that most people didn't appreciate well enough!
