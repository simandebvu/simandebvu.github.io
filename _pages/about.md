About Shingirayi Mandebvu 
======
 
I’m a full stack software developer. I have had experience in a variety of stacks and am currently reading and also starting my research in personalised medicine and its potential applications. I received my Bsc in Computer And Information Systems from  [Africa University](https://africau.edu) and currently a student with [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/).


I’m interested in applying personalized medicine approaches for public health and novel solutions to some of the challenges we have been facing like global warming. During my school years I was an active leader and participant who equal opportunities for all and in the power of community. I was part of school business initiatives which were but not limited to

- Gender Equality in business
- Technical appraches for social good


My key beliefs are kaizen and application of knowledge with the belief that one never stops learning, or improving. When I am not writing code, I am most probably trying to workout or binge watch something that most people didnt appreciate well enough!
